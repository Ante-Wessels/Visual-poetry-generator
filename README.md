# Visual-poetry-generator
An ad random visual poetry generator from 1999-2000. I like to keep it as it has always been, and only correct a typo, update some deprecated code and supporting html. 

The original in action:
https://amorvita.home.xs4all.nl/poem/poem.html

It's a java applet, use the CheerpJ applet extension for Chrome and some other browsers to see it.
