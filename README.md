# Visual-poetry-generator

An ad random visual poetry generator from 1999-2000. I like to keep it as it has always been, and only correct a typo, update some deprecated code and supporting html. 

The original should work with the Cheerpj Applet extention (Chrome, some others). Ignore the 1999 text about Java. If the pop up is blocked, open full screen window manually.

It's a java applet, use the CheerpJ applet extension for Chrome and some other browsers to see it.
