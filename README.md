# Visual-poetry-generator

Ad random visual poetry generator from 1999-2000. As Java on webpages was discontinued, the generator died. Mort pour toujours? No, the Cheerpj Applet extention (Chrome, some other browsers) brought Java applets back to life. 


# Compile

The Cheerpj Applet extention likes Java 8; in the project directory, compile with 

javac --release 8 poem_black_2026.java

Only works after being uploaded to server; doesn't work locally. After recompile, clear cache to avoid running earlier compiled class files. 

I like to keep the ad random visual poetry generator mostly as it has always been; I only corrected a typo, the help text, and updated supporting html. If you want to play with it, feel free to fork. Have fun!
